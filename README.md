PLC BASED COURIER PARCEL SORTING

The objective of this paper is to describe the process of PLC-based parcel 
sorting in industries. Automatic parcel sorting systems are critical for courier firms with 
large distribution capacity and short delivery times, and courier companies must 
improve the quality and reliability of their services as customers seek faster deliveries. 
Many courier businesses perform parcel sorting and placement manually, which is 
time consuming and inefficient. We decided to make it easier for courier firms by 
designing a system that performs all of these tasks without the need for human 
intervention. One of the essential projects for courier corporations is our proposed 
project, an automatic parcel sorting system based on PLC.
